In any war, it is always of value to one side to have good intelligence on the weapons resources of the other side. During the Second World War, for example, Allied military planners eagerly searched fro ways to accurately estimate the Axis production of tanks, aircrafts and numerous other weapons platforms. In the specific case of German tanks, a very clever way todo that was based on using either the stamped serial numbers or gearbox markings on captured Mark I and MArk V tanks, respectively. This type of problem has far wider applications.

We can experimentally see how well the formula that was used works in practice with a Monte Carlo Simulation. That is, the program first randomly picks a value for N (integer between 100 and 1000) with a value for the the sample size as a percentage of N.

The program then generates, randomly, n different integers in the interval 1 to N, the maximum of those integers is then used in the estimation formula to estimate a value for N. This estimate can be compared to the actual value of N to determine how weel the formual has performed. We investigate samples that are 2%, 5%, 10% and 20% of the population.
